˖ ݁ you fell down a rabbit hole ݁ ˖

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

a mysterious wifi network has caught your eye

against your better judgement, you connect.

... but there’s no internet?

your browser opens anyway

what you find is... quiet.

a single html page. reminciscent of e-ink technology.

zines, essays, books.

a digital library, floating in the air.

hosted on a raspberry pi, hiding in plain sight.

no servers. no surveillance. no strings.

just an offline wireless signal,

whispering stories of the horrors of technology to anyone nearby.

texts that made me want to dismantle a server farm with my bare hands.

this is library.local.

you have to be there. physically.

close enough to catch it in the air.

the signal: → github.com/naestech/library.local

the whisper: → naestech@proton.me
